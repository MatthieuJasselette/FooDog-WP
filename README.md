This is a small wordpress site about dog food.

## About

This wordpress site is an exercise unertaken during the becode formation.
The point was to recreate a UI using the wordpress theme functionality.
Most of it is based on the excellent tutorial from user taniarascia : [Developing a Wordpress Theme from Scratch](https://www.taniarascia.com/developing-a-wordpress-theme-from-scratch/)

This project uses wordpress, xampp and bootstrap.

## Installation

Install lampp, for instance with [xampp](https://www.apachefriends.org/download.html).

Clone this repo the htdocs folder of your lampp installation.

Use `opt/lampp/lampp start` to run your site.

Use `opt/lampp/lampp stop` to shut down your site.

In your database administration tool, import the *.sql* file in the db folder.

To edit the theme, tinker with the files found in */wp-content/themes/FooDog*.

## Usage

This site is supposed to be used to learn and test the wordpress theme functionality.
